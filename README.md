# âœ¨ Interactive Playground & Portfolio

Welcome to my digital playground! ðŸŽ® This collection of micro-apps is where creativity meets code, showcasing not just what I can build, but how I think about creating delightful user experiences.

Each mini-application here is a bite-sized demonstration of different technical skills and creative approaches, built with modern web technologies.
From smooth animations to interactive state management, every project has its own story to tell.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Inside?

This isn't just another portfolio â€“ it's an interactive journey! Each micro-app demonstrates different aspects of modern web development:

- ðŸŽ¨ Fluid animations and transitions
