# Interactive Portfolio & Development Showcase

Welcome to my portfolio of interactive micro-apps. This collection presents a series of focused applications that exemplify
various approaches to modern web development and user experience design.

Each project serves as a practical demonstration of specific technical implementations and design patterns,
utilising web technologies and frameworks.
